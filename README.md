# Tesla Browser App

This is my React based app to act as a `Default` homepage for my Tesla vehicle Browser. Given that Tesla doesn’t provide any location-based weather in the vehicle, this was my attempt to create a single homepage to provide location-based weather, traffic, news and Yelp POI’s. Unfortunately, Tesla has removed the ability to allow the geolocation api within the local browser and thus this app does not currently work as designed within a Tesla. I am hoping that a future update will include some sort of support and I will continue to develop the app.
