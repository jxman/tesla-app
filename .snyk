# DOM-based XSS False Positive - src/components/News.jsx:285
# Issue: javascript/DOMXSS on <img src={article.safeImageUrl} />
#
# FALSE POSITIVE JUSTIFICATION:
# The flagged code uses article.safeImageUrl which is pre-sanitized with multiple layers:
# 1. DOMPurify.sanitize() at fetch time (line 74: sanitizeImageUrl())
# 2. URL() constructor validation for proper format (line 154)
# 3. Protocol whitelist enforcement - only http/https allowed (line 157-160)
# 4. DOMPurify strict configuration with ALLOWED_URI_REGEXP: /^https?:\/\// (line 169-173)
# 5. Null safety checks - invalid URLs don't render (line 267)
#
# Static analysis taint tracking doesn't recognize the sanitization boundary
# established by sanitizeImageUrl() function (lines 144-181).
