# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Tesla Dashboard is a React-based web application with a modern tabbed interface designed as a homepage replacement for Tesla vehicle browsers. It provides enhanced weather forecasts, traffic conditions, news updates, and real nearby places in a Tesla-optimized interface.

**Key Features:**
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Single-tab interface with Weather, Traffic, News, and Places tabs
- **Enhanced Weather**: 12-hour and 10-day forecasts with horizontal scrolling and drag support
- **Real Places Integration**: OpenStreetMap-based nearby places with 7 Tesla-relevant categories
- **Live News Feed**: Categorized content (Headlines, Tech, Business, Science) with refresh
- **Traffic Conditions**: Waze integration for real-time traffic data
- **Touch-Optimized**: Drag scrolling, large touch targets, Tesla browser compatible
- **Tesla-themed UI**: Dark theme with Tesla-inspired design elements

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
- **Start development server**: `npm start` (runs on port 3000)
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Run tests**: `npm test`
- **Eject (not recommended)**: `npm run eject`

### Development Testing Protocol
**For Claude Code development assistance:**
- **User's server**: Always runs on port 3000 (`http://localhost:3000`)
- **Testing changes**: Use port 3002 to avoid conflicts (`PORT=3002 BROWSER=none npm start`)
- **Always test compilation** before asking user to verify changes

### No Linting/Type Checking
This project uses standard Create React App setup without additional linting or TypeScript. Code style is enforced through consistent patterns rather than automated tools.

## Project Architecture

### State Management
The application uses React Context API for global state management:

- **TeslaAppContext** (`src/context/TeslaAppContext.js`): Central state manager handling:
  - Location coordinates (lat/long) with GPS detection
  - Current weather data and 5-day forecast from OpenWeather API
  - Loading states and error handling for all APIs
  - Location search functionality (GPS + zip code)
  - Forecast data for enhanced Weather component features

### Component Structure
```

├── App.js                      # Tabbed interface with state-driven navigation
├── context/
│   └── TeslaAppContext.js     # Global state with forecast data
├── components/
│   ├── LocationSelector.jsx   # Header with search and branding

│   ├── Traffic.jsx           # Waze traffic embed
│   ├── News.jsx             # News feed with categories
│   └── Places.jsx           # OpenStreetMap places integration
└── shared/
    └── Spinner.jsx          # Loading component
```

### Layout Architecture
The app uses a modern tabbed interface:
- **Navigation**: 4 tabs (Weather, Traffic, News, Places) with icons and active states
- **Single Content Area**: Full-height viewport optimization with calc(100vh - 200px)
- **Active Tab Display**: One component visible at a time, optimized for touch interaction
- **Header**: LocationSelector with Tesla branding and search (persistent across tabs)

### API Integration Patterns

**Weather API (OpenWeather)**:
- Context manages API calls and caching
- Handles both GPS coordinates and zip code geocoding
- Error states for API failures and invalid keys
- Automatic retry functionality

**News API**:
- Component-level state management
- Category-based filtering (general, technology, business, science)
- Local caching with refresh timestamps
- Comprehensive error handling for API limits

**Traffic Integration**:
- Embedded Waze iframe using current coordinates
- Updates automatically when location changes

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env`:
```env
# OpenWeather API
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key

# News API
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_URL=https://newsapi.org/v2

# Default location (Boston coordinates)
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_LAT=42.364506
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_LON=-71.038887
```

## Styling Architecture

**CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI components
**Theme**: Tesla-inspired dark theme with:
- Background: `bg-gray-900` (main), `bg-gray-800` (cards)
- Tesla Red accent: `#dc2626` (used in branding)
- Gray scale for text hierarchy
- Blue accents for interactive elements

**Responsive Design**:
- Grid layout adapts to screen size
- Components use Tailwind responsive prefixes
- Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancements

## Key Development Patterns

### Tabbed Navigation
- React state-driven tab switching with activeTab state
- Component lazy loading - only active tab renders
- Touch-optimized tab buttons with visual feedback
- Persistent header across all tabs for unified experience

### Enhanced Weather Features
- 12-hour forecast with horizontal scrolling
- 10-day forecast with extended weather patterns
- Drag/touch scrolling with mouse and touch event handlers
- Hourly/Daily toggle with animated transitions
- Forecast data from OpenWeather 5-day API

### Places Integration
- OpenStreetMap Overpass API for real place data
- 7 Tesla-relevant categories (Food, Gas, Charging, Hotels, Shopping, Fun, Services)
- Smart API fallback system (Google Places → Foursquare → OpenStreetMap)
- Touch-optimized horizontal scrolling place cards
- Distance calculations and Google Maps integration

### Location Management
- GPS location detection with fallback to default (Boston)
- Zip code search with OpenWeather geocoding
- Context provides unified location state across components
- Real-time location updates for Places component

### Error Handling
- API error states with user-friendly messages
- Retry functionality for failed requests
- Loading states with spinners and skeleton screens
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios

### Performance Optimization
- useMemo for expensive calculations (categories, forecast data)
- useCallback for event handlers to prevent re-renders
- Component-level caching for API responses
- Efficient scroll event handling with requestAnimationFrame

### Tesla Integration Considerations
- Originally designed for Tesla vehicle browsers
- Currently limited by Tesla's geolocation API restrictions
- Optimized for in-vehicle use case (large fonts, simple navigation)

## Dependencies & Versions

**Core Dependencies**:
- React 18.3.1 (hooks-based with useMemo/useCallback optimization)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 + DaisyUI 4.12.24 (touch-optimized components)
- React Icons 5.5.0 (tab navigation icons: FiCloud, FiNavigation, FiRss, FiMapPin)
- Moment.js 2.29.1 (date formatting for forecasts and timestamps)

**Performance Features**:
- React.useMemo for category definitions and expensive calculations
- React.useCallback for event handlers and API calls
- Horizontal scrolling with native browser scroll optimization
- Component-level state management to minimize re-renders

**Build Tools**:
- Create React App 5.0.1 (webpack, babel, dev server)
- PostCSS + Autoprefixer (CSS processing)

## Testing & Quality

- Uses React Testing Library + Jest (standard CRA setup)
- No additional testing configuration
- Manual testing recommended for API integrations
- Focus on component rendering and user interactions
